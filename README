File2Obj

file2Obj is a tiny program that reads an input file and outputs a C source code
which can be compiled and linked with other projects that require embedding of
files into the application program.

INVOCATION:

    file2obj <input-file> <C-variable-name> > <outfile.c>
    
    <input-file>        - The file to be embedded.
    <C-variable-name>   - The variable name for the data.
    <outfile.c>         - The output file.

The C souce file outputted consists of the following:

    * unsigned char * EMBED_DATA_{VARIABLE};
        The pointer to the data. To be used only after initialisation.

    * unsigned long EMBED_DATA_{VARIABLE}_LENGTH();
        Returns an unsigned long denoting the length of the data.
    
    * int EMBED_DATA_{VARIABLE}_INIT();
        Allocates memory and copies the data into it.
        Returns '0' when memory can not be allocated.
        Returns '1' to indicate success.
        
    * void EMBED_DATA_{VARIABLE}_CLOSE();
        Can be manually called to free the data.
        Added to atexit(..) during initialisation.
